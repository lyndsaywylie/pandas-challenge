One very clear trend is that charter schools performed significantly better than district schools. 

Also, per grade math scores for 11th grade reading seemed extremely odd. How every school received  the exact same average 
to the 6th decimal indicates 3 things: My code is wrong, they all coincidentally came to the exact same mean, or they all
cheated and took the test together. 

Another trend is the amount of spending budget per student. Charter schools are on the lower end of the spectrum, while
district schools are on the higher end of the spectrum. I find that interesting when I dissect the average score and overall
passing scores. You will see that charter schools have an overall higher passing percentage than district schools and that
is due to the fact that the overall passing math scores are sigificantly better. However, when comparing the reading scores
for charter versus district there is not much of difference. 

One other trend we can deduce from the school size summary is that larger schools have a lower overall passing percentage.
since we know that charter schools have a higher overall passing percentage largely due to the fact that they have better
math scores, we can safely say that the larger schools are mainly, if not all, district schools
